# Wii-USB-C-Plug
Made a plug for the Wii USB C power mod so that theres no cutting what so ever in the shell

The Wii is officially stated to run at 12 volts & 3.75 amps but there's some wiggle room since it doesn't seem to mind running at 12 volts & 2.5 amps

I made this bezel so that its held in by itself but the I reccomend hot gluing the board into the bezel

I printed this with a 0.4mm nozzle

How to do the mod: TakDesolder the AC port and solder in the USB C board
